## Module 10 Challenge: SQLAlchemy and Serving Data with APIs
---

<b>Programming language:</b> Python <br />
<b>Package used:</b> sqlalchemy, flask, pandas, numpy, matplotlib <br />
<b>Main script:</b> SQLAlchemy [(climate_starter.ipynb)](https://github.com/wingylui/Sqlalchemy_challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/climate_starter.ipynb) Serving Data with APIs using Flask [(app.py)](https://github.com/wingylui/Sqlalchemy_challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/app.py)<br />
<b>Dataset:</b> [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/wingylui/Sqlalchemy_challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/Resources/hawaii.sqlite)

This challenge is to analyse the climate in Honolulu, Hawaii and building an weather API to extract the weather history in Hawaii. In climate starter, data is extracted from the sqlite dataset using SQLAlchemy and investigate the precipitation in 2016 and 2017. Bar chart and histogram are generated using matplotlib. In app.py, an API was builded to export the query results from the SQLAlchemy using Flask.
